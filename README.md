# Youtube Video Transript Search
This chrome browser extension allows you to search for keywords in a video (as long as it has a transcript available) and get timestamps and text that contain that keyword! It allows you to then navigate the video based on the relevant keywords you entered.
No longer are the days of skimming for minutes on a 4 hour podcast to see a topic you're interested in being discussed.

## What I learned
I learned a lot, especially since this was my first ever browser extension project! Update coming...
